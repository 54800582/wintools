 RAMMap.exe --  Physical Memory Analyzer and Cleaner V1.0 for x64 windows 10 or later

 2024/06/07
 WinObj.exe -- WinObj is a must-have tool if you are a system administrator concerned about security, a developer tracking down object-related problems, or just curious about the Object Manager namespace.

 2024/06/13
 PoolMon.exe -- PoolMon (poolmon.exe), the Memory Pool Monitor, displays data that the operating system collects about memory allocations from the system paged and nonpaged kernel pools, and the memory pools used for Terminal Services sessions. The data is grouped by pool allocation tag.

 2024/06/20
 MemoryCleaner.exe -- Memory Cleaner is considerably better because it uses functions built into Windows to judiciously free memory - with no performance impact whatsoever. You can now access Memory Cleaner functions from the tray icon without having to open up the main window. The cleaning prodecures are both silent and the only alert you will see is the amount of RAM recovered briefly displayed in the window. If you find your RAM usage exceeding 60% regularly, then MemoryCleaner is an absolute must have.
